# Tetris
This is a Tetris Clone developed from the beginning of 2023 in Processing. I designed it to have an NES style of gameplay with some comfort features of modern Tetris.

Features:
- Home, pause, and game over menus
- Saving high scores after closing the app
- Seven-bag (you can never get three of the same tetromino in a row & prevents droughts)
- Able to see next three tetrominos
- Able to hold a tetromino
- Can customize & save keybinds and delays
- Saves game-state if window is closed mid-game

Controls:
- All gameplay controls are available in the settings
- Backspace: closes window
- Escape: pauses game mid-game, closes window in menu
