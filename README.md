# Cetruus
This is a Tetris Clone developed from the beginning of 2023 in Processing. I designed it to have an NES scoring & gameplay, with some comfort features of modern Tetris.

Features:
- Saving high scores after closing the app
- Seven-bag (you can never get three of the same tetromino in a row & prevents droughts)
- Able to see next three tetrominos
- Able to hold a tetromino
- Can customize & save keybinds and delays
- Teacher/Boss-proof
  - Saves game-state if window is closed mid-game
  - Pauses game if alt-tabs 

Controls:
- All gameplay controls are available & customizable in the settings
- Backspace: closes window
- Escape: pauses game mid-game, closes window in menu
